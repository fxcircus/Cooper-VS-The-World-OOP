# Cooper VS The World
A turn based fighting game inspired by the original Pok√©mon games for the Game Boy Color.

## Synopsis 
Cooper wants to go for a walk.
During the walk, he tackles his greatest fears:
A garbage truck, a sprinkler, and fireworks.

Help Cooper beat his enemies and conquer his fears!

## Rules
You play as my dog Cooper, against the computer.

There are 3 battles in the game.
A short animation plays between the rounds to show player progression.
The battles load automatically at the end of each segment.

The player must win all 3 battles to beat the game.
Loosing a battle will result in loosing the game.
There are dedicated pages for winning or loosing state where you can reload the page. 

## Combat mechanics
Cooper starts with 100 HP.
Enemy HP Varies.

Cooper has 2 attacks: 
- Fish breath: does 60 base damage
- Lick: does 30 base damage

 And 2 items (Item buffs carry on to future battles!):
- Treat: Adds 25 HP and adds +10 each consecutive use
- Bone: Adds 100 damage to all attacks 

Cooper always gets the first turn. He can attack or use an item.
Then the enemy gets a turn.
The battle continues until Cooper or his enemies reach 0 hit points.

Each player has an accuracy ratio that determines whether they hit or miss.
If they miss - the other player gets a turn.
If they hit - the attack does between 50% to 100% of its damage points.
